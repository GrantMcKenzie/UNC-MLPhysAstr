Course Description
Machine learning is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic areas of modern physics research and data application. This course introduces the core concepts, theory and tools of machine learning as required by physicists and astronomers addressing practical data analysis tasks. Topics will include statistics, scientific data set exploration, feature engineering, neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning. Students will learn how to select and preprocess data, design machine learning models, evaluate model performance, and relate model inputs and outputs to the underlying physics concepts. We will apply these methods to the domains of collider physics, neutrino physics, astronomy, and others. There will also be a final project in which students will work in groups to generate a result from a novel dataset.


This course is based on Viviana Acquaviva's textbook "Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy."  

A summary of the repository contents: 

Data: All data sets needed to complete the studios and homework for the course. Citations for data sets can be found in the textbook. 

Studios: Studio assignments for each week of the class. Most studio materials are interactive python notebooks with "fill-in-the-blank" code sections and interspersed questions.

Problem Set Notebooks: Notebooks for the 6 problem sets included in the course. Homework sets include a mix of open-ended questions and coding assignments; only motebooks for coding assignments are made available here.
